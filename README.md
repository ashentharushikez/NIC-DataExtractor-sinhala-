NIC Text Extraction System for Sri Lanka ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°

A Python-based system for extracting text from Sri Lankan National Identity Cards (NICs) using Google Gemini AI, OpenCV, and OCR techniques. The system also supports Tamil-to-Sinhala translation to enhance accuracy.

ðŸŒŸ Features

Extracts text from NIC images using OCR.

Enhances text accuracy with Google Gemini AI.

Preprocesses images using OpenCV for better OCR results.

Supports Tamil-to-Sinhala translation for improved understanding.

Provides structured output for easy integration with other applications.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Python - Core programming language.

OpenCV - Image processing library.

Tesseract OCR - Optical character recognition for text extraction.

Google Gemini AI - AI-powered enhancement of extracted text.

Google Translate API - Tamil-to-Sinhala translation.
